# AircraftRequirements
This code analyzes the range, endurance, and performance of an aircraft given simple inputs, simple calculations, and simple outputs.

The code can be modified easily for optimization studies and change of aircraft parameters.

Documentation is provided mostly in the code.

- AeroData.py supplies aerodynamic characteristics. Specifically, Coefficient of Lift & Drag w.r.t. angle of attack
- MinFlightE.py stands for "minimum flight energy", the original name I gave to this study. Parameters must be changed inline, not during runtime. (easy to change this though)
